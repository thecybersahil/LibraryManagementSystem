# LibraryManagementSystem

This code defines two classes: Book and Library. Book contains the information about a single book, 
while Library contains the list of books and methods for adding, removing, and searching for books.

The main method of the LibraryManagement class serves as the user interface, allowing users to interact with the library by adding, removing, and searching for books.
